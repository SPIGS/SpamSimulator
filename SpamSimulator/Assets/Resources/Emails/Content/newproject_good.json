    "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nThanks for sending over the project proposal. I reviewed it and I think it looks great overall. There are a few areas where we might want to make some adjustments, but we can discuss those further during our next meeting. Overall, though, I think this is a project that has a lot of potential.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you want to schedule a time to discuss further.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJane"

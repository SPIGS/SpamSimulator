    "Hi team,\r\n\r\nI'm having some issues with my computer. It keeps making strange noises and the screen is flashing strange colors. I've tried restarting it a few times but the problem keeps coming back. Does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this? I really need to get this fixed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSamantha"

    "Hi Alice,\r\n\r\nI wanted to thank you and your team for meeting with us yesterday. Overall, I thought it was productive and we made some good progress. That being said, I'm sorry about what happened with Tom. It was definitely an uncomfortable situation for everyone involved. I hope it doesn't jeopardize our collaboration moving forward. Let me know if you have any concerns.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJack"

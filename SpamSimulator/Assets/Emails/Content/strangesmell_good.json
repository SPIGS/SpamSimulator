    "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nHas anyone else noticed a strange smell in the break room? It smells kind of like burnt popcorn mixed with something else that I can't quite place. I looked around but I couldn't find anything that could be causing it. If anyone knows what's going on, please let me know. Thanks!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTom"

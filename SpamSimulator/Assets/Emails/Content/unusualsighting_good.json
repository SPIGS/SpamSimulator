    "Hi team,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to give everyone a heads up about an unusual sighting I had in the break room this morning. I'm not sure if it was a rat or a large mouse, but it was definitely not a common sight around here. I've already let the facilities team know, but please be careful when using the break room until they can investigate and address the situation.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLisa"

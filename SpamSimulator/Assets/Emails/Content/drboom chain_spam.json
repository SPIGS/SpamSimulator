    "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI got this video from a friend of a friend who knows a guy who used to work with someone who was in the room when it happened. Apparently, this video was taken at a dog show in Kansas City last year, and it's been making the rounds online ever since.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and I just had to share it with you. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say it involves a poodle, a tutu, and a surprise guest.\r\n\r\nI hope this brings a smile to your face like it did for me. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\nDr. Zoom]"

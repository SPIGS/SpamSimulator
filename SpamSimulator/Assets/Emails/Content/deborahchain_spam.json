    "Dear friend,\r\n\r\nYou won't believe what I just received in my inbox. It's an important message that's been forwarded around the internet, and I wanted to share it with you so that you can pass it along to your loved ones. We need to spread the word about this issue!\r\n\r\nApparently, there's a new computer virus going around that can hack into your computer and steal your personal information. It's called the 'Dark Web Virus' and it's one of the most dangerous viruses out there. Once it's on your computer, it can do anything from stealing your bank information to taking control of your webcam and spying on you.\r\n\r\nThe only way to protect yourself is to forward this message to everyone you know. Spread the word and make sure your friends and family are protected!\r\n\r\nThank you for doing your part in keeping the internet safe.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDeborah"

    "Dear pun-loving friends,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you pun-ctual and pun-derful as always! As you know, the Department of Dad Jokes takes its responsibility to provide quality dad jokes very seriously. That is why I'm writing to you today with an important update.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting extensive research, we have found that the optimal frequency for telling dad jokes is 1 joke per 2.78 minutes. This ensures a steady stream of groans and eye-rolls without overwhelming your audience with too much pun-ishment.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to remind you to always practice safe pun-ning. Remember to wear your pun-derwear and never leave home without a pun-scription for your pun medication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. May your puns be ever in your favor.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nThe Department of Dad Jokes"
